This will initially be a workout log website.  Eventually, a workout log app.

My weightlifting philosophy:
1. Your program will work if you work.
2. Know your protein intake.
3. Know your body fatigue.

With these ideas in mind, I set out to create an application that allows for a UI that is just as simple as the philosophy. There are two things that absolutely must be tracked if you want optimal results: your program and protein intake. Both of these have a direct relationship with time, therefore, it made sense to begin the interface (and likely home page) with a calendar view.

* This is the full year calendar mobile view I have completed. You will be able to tap the month to see a month view, then tap on a day to see the day view.

* This is what the drop down menu looks like as of now on mobile. More links may be added; links may be altered.

## Currently working on: 
the individual month view - dynamically loading exercises to the specified day.
